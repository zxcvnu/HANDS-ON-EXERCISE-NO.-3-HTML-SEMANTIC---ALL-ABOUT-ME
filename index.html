                <h2> Our Lifestory</h2>
                <p>I was born on the third day in the month of April, in the year of the snake.
                    I'm the fourth child in a family of seven children, including four boys and three girls. I don't remember much about the early years of my infant life,
                    as I never heard about it from my parents (and never asked), and I also don't have proof of it because there aren't any mementos from my infancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important memory from my early childhood that still exists
                     in my subconscious mind is how one day my father brought me along
                      to the paddy field on his broad and strong shoulders, like I was a young king.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second memory that still influences me happened during one of the many festivals that we have to celebrate
                     according to our custom. I fell sick, and I was given special care by the many guests that came to our house 
                     for the celebration my parents held. On this special occasion, I was freely roaming around, sitting on a big 
                     laddel made of wood. It was as though I was riding a motorcycle, with the sound of an engine running, although
                      I wasn't familiar with motorcycles at that point in my life.
